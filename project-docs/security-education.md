# Security Education for Users

## Understanding the Security Model

### How the Tool Works
1. **Client-Side Processing**
   - All operations happen in your browser
   - No data is sent to any server
   - No data is stored or logged
   - Memory is cleared after use

2. **Encryption Process**
   - Uses AES-GCM encryption
   - Each operation uses a unique initialization vector
   - Password generation is deterministic but secure
   - High entropy is maintained throughout

### Security Implications

#### What This Tool Provides
- üîí Secure password generation from inspect links
- üîÑ Reversible conversion (password ‚Üî link)
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection against common attacks
- üì± Local-only processing

#### What This Tool Does NOT Provide
- ‚ùå Protection against keyloggers
- ‚ùå Protection against screen capture
- ‚ùå Protection against clipboard monitoring
- ‚ùå Protection against malware
- ‚ùå Protection against physical access to your device

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Password Storage**
   - Store passwords in a secure password manager
   - Never share passwords through unencrypted channels
   - Use unique passwords for different services
   - Enable two-factor authentication where available

2. **Device Security**
   - Keep your operating system updated
   - Use antivirus software
   - Be cautious of screen recording software
   - Lock your device when not in use

3. **Browser Security**
   - Use a modern, updated browser
   - Be cautious of browser extensions
   - Clear sensitive data from clipboard
   - Use private/incognito mode when appropriate

4. **Network Security**
   - Use secure networks (avoid public WiFi)
   - Enable HTTPS everywhere
   - Use a VPN when on untrusted networks
   - Be cautious of network monitoring

### Common Security Threats

1. **Keyloggers**
   - Software that records keystrokes
   - Can capture passwords as you type
   - Use password managers to avoid typing

2. **Screen Capture**
   - Malware can take screenshots
   - Avoid showing sensitive information
   - Use privacy screens when in public

3. **Clipboard Monitoring**
   - Some malware monitors clipboard
   - Clear clipboard after copying
   - Use password managers with auto-clear

4. **Shoulder Surfing**
   - People watching your screen
   - Be aware of your surroundings
   - Use privacy screens in public

### What to Do If Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Change all affected passwords
   - Scan for malware
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Monitor accounts for suspicious activity

2. **Preventive Measures**
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Use unique passwords
   - Keep software updated
   - Regular security audits
